GTM-Visitor-Intelligence

After adding the template from the template gallery, enter your api key (apixxxx) given by your Dun & Bradstreet Implementation Manager. Have the tag fire on ALL pages.

To connect Visitor Intelligence data to Google Analytics, enter your Google Analytics account id, and add the data into
custom dimensions that you have enabled.

Note: This tag creates an event, "DnB VI" that pushes all data into the data layer for you to use wherever you need.
